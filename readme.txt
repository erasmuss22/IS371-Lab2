In the first exercise, I made revisions that enhance the way customer data is displayed. 
There is a drop down of previous customers to facilitate the information entry process and 
show data on those customers. In excercise 2 I have a robust traversal system that doesn't
allow a user to advance between transactions if there aren't any. Buttons also become disabled
at appropriate times. For exercise 3 I made it so the even must make sense. For example if an
order is already compelte, it doesn't make sense to take that same order or process it.
